# active_admin_filters_defaults

Default values for Active Admin index filters.

Some index pages are not "a list you may want to narrow down", they are "a list that is only
meaningful, or only affordable, inside a window": a log table partitioned by date, a page backed
by an external service that will not answer an unbounded query, a queue an agent should land on.
Active Admin has no way to say so, so every app of this size grows a `before_action` that mutates
`params[:q]`. This is that, as an option on the filter itself.

```ruby
ActiveAdmin.register Order do
  filter :state_eq, as: :select, collection: %w[pending paid], default: "pending"
end
```

## Install

```ruby
gem "active_admin_filters_defaults", github: "activeadmin-plugins/active_admin_filters_defaults"
```

Pre-1.0 and not on RubyGems yet: the option name and the shape of its value may still change.

## Usage

A default is a **value**. Which Ransack key it lands under is the input's business, and the
input is asked - so a `:select` gets `_eq`, a `:check_boxes` gets `_in` under the association's
primary key, and a `:string` gets whichever predicate heads its dropdown, including when the
resource or the namespace has reordered that list:

```ruby
filter :status,     as: :select,      default: "active"
filter :author,     as: :check_boxes, default: [1, 2]
filter :created_at, as: :date_range,  default: -> { 1.week.ago..Time.current }
filter :created_at, as: :date_range,  default: -> { 1.week.ago.. }       # lower bound only
filter :title,                        default: "acme"
```

**A Range** fills a two-ended input, one bound per end; leave an end off and that end is left to
the admin. Handing a single value to a two-ended input raises, rather than picking an end for you.

Anything relative to now belongs in a Proc, as above. `filter` runs when the resource file is
loaded, so `default: 1.week.ago..` would pin the window to the moment the process booted and let
it drift for as long as that process lives - quietly, and worst on the long-running ones. A Proc
is re-read on every request.

**A Proc** is evaluated against the controller on every request, and a `nil` result applies no
filter, which is how a default is made conditional or read off the signed-in admin:

```ruby
filter :author_id_eq, default: -> { current_admin_user.id unless current_admin_user.admin? }
filter :queue_eq,     default: -> { current_admin_user.default_queue }
```

Asking the input means you get whatever that input actually submits, which is not always the
predicate the docs of some other app would lead you to expect. A `:string` filter submits the
head of its dropdown, and an app that re-registers Ransack's aliases - `contains`, `equals`,
`starts_with` - reorders that list, so `default: "acme"` may search for equality rather than a
substring. That is correct, since it is what an untouched form submits there, but check it
rather than assume.

Deriving needs a resource Ransack can search. A resource backed by something else - an
ActiveResource model standing in for an HTTP API, say - has no `ransack`, and the derivation
raises rather than guessing:

    filter :created_at declares a `default:` but could not work out which search key it submits
    (NoMethodError: undefined method 'ransack' ...) - name the predicate with a Hash instead

**A Hash** names the predicates outright, for that case and for when the input's own predicate
is not the one you want:

```ruby
filter :title, default: { eq: "acme" }                 # rather than the _cont it would submit
filter :created_at, as: :date_range, default: { gteq: -> { 1.week.ago } }
```

A filter hidden by `:if` or `:unless` imposes no default either — it would filter the collection
with no control on screen to undo it.

## Getting out of a default

Defaults apply only while the request carries no filters of its own.

* The default also seeds the visible form, so the admin can see why the list is filtered and edit
  that value like any other filter.
* **Blank the field and press Filter** to see the unfiltered collection. Active Admin disables
  empty fields on submit, so a blank submission sends no `q` at all and is told apart from a first
  visit by `commit`.
* **Clear Filters** drops `commit` along with `q`, so it returns the page to its defaults rather
  than to an empty filter set.

## Widening when the defaults apply

By default they apply to a request that carries no filters of its own. A resource that always
carries something in `q` — a customer id pinned by a nested route, say — can widen that:

```ruby
controller do
  def filter_defaults_apply?
    super || params[:q].keys == %w[customer_id_eq]
  end
end
```

Whatever the request asked for wins over a default, so the pinned value survives.

## Telling the admin why

An index that quietly shows a slice of the table owes the admin a word about it. That part is
optional and is not installed on its own, since Active Admin has no notion of a flash about
filters:

```ruby
# config/initializers/active_admin.rb
require "active_admin_filters_defaults/notice"

ActiveAdmin.register Export do
  default_filters_notice "Records for the last month are displayed by default"
  filter :created_at, as: :date_range, default: { gteq: -> { 1.month.ago } }
end
```

The message is flashed only when the defaults actually took effect. Pass `flash_key:` to use
something other than `:notice`.

## How it works

Four `prepend`s, no source patching:

* `ActiveAdmin::ResourceController` — `apply_filtering` searches on `filtering_params`, a new
  overridable method, instead of reading `params[:q]` directly. `params` itself is never written
  to: the filter inputs read their value from the Ransack object, and the defaults are derived
  again on every request that carries no `q`, so paging, sorting and download links keep them.
* `ActiveAdmin::Resource` — the filters sidebar is handed the filters that `:if` and `:unless`
  allow, so the same set is rendered and consulted for defaults, and the conditions are resolved
  once rather than once per side.
* `ActiveAdmin::Filters::ViewHelper` — the form renders what it is given, and `:default` is taken
  out of the options before Formtastic sees them.
* `ActiveAdmin::Filters::ActiveSidebar` — the Current Filters panel was gated on `params[:q]`,
  which stays empty when the values came from `default:`, so it now also shows for those.

`default:` needs no registration of its own: `add_filter` stores whatever options it is given,
without a whitelist.

Tested against Active Admin 3.5 on Rails 7.2 and 8.0.
